      <description>I&#39;ve always found well-written essays particularly fascinating, to the point that I&#39;ve decided to experiment on finding a method to convey messages effectively that suits me. In order to feel committed, I purchased a domain on Google Domains (took 5 minutes in total and â‚¬15) and hosted this basic website. I have always used R at work and I am planning to transition from sales/acc. management roles to more analytical ones, This space will be used to collect gotchas and observations I find interesting through this path.</description>
