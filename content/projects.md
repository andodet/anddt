Here's a list of things (updated infrequently) that made it to a "presentable" stage:

- [**`git-overview`**](https://github.com/andodet/git-overview) | [**post**]({{< relref "2021-07-10-git-streamlit.md" >}}): 
Streamlit dashboard to show high-level metrics and activity for git repostories.
- [**`googlePubsubR`**](https://github.com/andodet/googlePubsubR): A simple R interface for Google Cloud Pub/Sub, also 
available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/googlePubsubR/index.html).
