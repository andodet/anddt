## Intro

A few weeks ago I have stumbled upon [this](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27689664) post on hackernews containing a 
captivating piece of data visualization on the development history of git. I believe the visualization is particularly powerful
for a few different reasons:
* It packs a lot of information in a clear and concise way without being overwhelming
* It is aesthetically very appealing
* It as some basic interactivity, letting the user drill down on each individual contributor

Lacking a traditional background in computer science, I've never thought of the type of data that could be generated by the
development process itself. This sparked my interest to build a simple dashboard with the following requirements:
- Doesn't have to be aesthetically appealing. This choice has been taken out of sheer laziness: I definitely wanted to avoid spending
too much time wrestling with css code over a weekend.
- Should allow users to explore any repo they can think of
- Should allow to filter commits by date
- Should allow users to filter commits by contributor
 
## Exploring a few tools

I am a long time [`{shiny}`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) user and it is hands down my go-to library for any dashboard that goes beyond
average complexity. Over the years, its development process has greatly improved, going from monolithic files to [libraries](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem) 
supporting a more modular and workflow-oriented approach.

In the past year or so I've been working mostly on Python projects as putting R in production is not a viable option, as most of the clients I've
dealt with wouldn't have internal resources to maintain production-ready R code. Instead of building yet another Shiny app, I set myself to find something
equivalent in Python.

Surprisingly enough, finding something as mature and easy to use as Shiny has being sort of a struggle. The following are a bunch of libraries
I've found during research and not all of them have been researched in much detail (hence feel free to disagree on any of the comments below):
* [Plotly dash](https://plotly.com/dash/): albeit Plotly being one of the most common plotting libraries (allowing extensive interactivity) I 
decided not to go with this option for a few reasons:
    * I wouldn't be able to mix plotting libraries if a specific visualization required anything more specific.
    * You can definitely solve the point above by fiddling with `flask` (used for its backend) but I could see myself spending more time on it
    than on the actual visualization
    * It lacks a proper layout template meaning that I'd have to arrange and style each component by hand and write proper .css stylesheets
* [Bokeh](://bokeh.org/): looks like a nice visualization library with some interactivity baked in it. Unfortunately the "dashboarding" part is left
to the user.
* [Spyre](https://github.com/adamhajari/spyre): abandoned project (last commit dating back to 3 years ago).

After some research I decided to give [streamlit](https://streamlit.io) a go as it offers the right amount of interactivity and its layout approach, albeit
being a bit restrictive, looks flexible enough to churn out something decent in a relatively short amount of time.

## Project structure

The project has been structured in the following way:
```sh
.
├── app
│   ├── dashboard.py  # the actual dashboard
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── repo.py  # some helper functions to download data
│   ├── ui.py  # plot functions
│   └── utils.py  # some dashboard-related helpers
├── Dockerfile  
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt
```

This allows to keep the app organized in three distinct blocks with the following logic:
* Everything related to plotting and user interaction should live in `ui.py`. This could be further split into `plots.py` and `ui.py` when building
large apps to avoid having too much stuff in the same module
* Data preprocessing and helper methods live in `utils.py`
* The dashboard is assembled in `dashboard.py`
* `repo.py` deals with retrieving the commit history from a remote git repository

Following the logic above, a very stripped down app might look like something in the lines of:

[`dashboard.py`](https://github.com/andodet/git-overview/blob/master/app/dashboard.py ):
```python
import streamlit as st

import utils
import ui


def body(data):
    # Grab the sidebar filter values declared in `ui.py`
    a = ui.get_sidebar(data)

    # Filter data
    data  = utils.filter_by_a(data, a)

    # Display dataframe in a container 
    with st.beta_container():
        ui.write_table(data)
    

if __name__ == "__main__":
    data = utils.get_data()
    body = body(data)
```

[`ui.py`](https://github.com/andodet/git-overview/blob/master/app/ui.py):
```python
import streamlit as st
import utils

def get_sidebar(data):
    # Just one filter as an example
    a_max = int(data['A'].max())
    a_min = int(data['A'].min())
    a = st.sidebar.slider("Filter by A", min_value=a_min, max_value=a_max)

    # NOTE: you can return a tuple if mulitple filters are applied
    return a

def write_table(data):
    return st.dataframe(data, height=1000)
```

[`utils.py`](https://github.com/andodet/git-overview/blob/master/app/utils.py):
```python
import streamlit as st

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np


def get_data():
    # Just generate some random data
    seed = np.random.RandomState(seed = 1234)
    df = pd.DataFrame(seed.uniform(low=0,high=100,size=(100, 5)), columns=list('ABCDF'))
    return df


def filter_by_a(data, val):
    return data[data['A'] >= val]
```

I am sure there are plenty of better ways to organize code especially for larger projects (leveraging folders for instance), but the current structure
has been more than enough for the size of this experiment.

## Overview of `dplyr` activity

Coming from an R background it came pretty natural to have a look at [`{dplyr}`](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr) commit history. As expected, it is 
clear how the bulk of the library was written by Hadley, Romain Francois, Kiril Muller and Lionel Henry. 

[![](/images/2021-07-10-git-streamlit/top_contributors.png)](/images/2021-07-10-git-streamlit/top_contributors.png)
[![](/images/2021-07-10-git-streamlit/cumulative_contributors.png)](/images/2021-07-10-git-streamlit/cumulative_contributors.png)

Also, it seems that most contributors have added a large number of lines around January 2021. This makes
perfect sense as around that time [`dplyr 1.0.3`](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/releases/tag/v1.0.3) was released.

Rebuilding documentation is one of the central steps of R package development workflow, this can be spotted by comparing the number of daily commits and lines 
changed. Surprisingly there have been days in which the number of commits has been fairly small while having touched a large number of lines. Such pattern can be
spotted in late January 2021:

[![](/images/2021-07-10-git-streamlit/commits.png)](/images/2021-07-10-git-streamlit/commits.png)
[![](/images/2021-07-10-git-streamlit/lines_added.png)](/images/2021-07-10-git-streamlit/lines_added.png)

In fact, on Jan 29 2021 a large [update](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/commit/284e77e4aa03cf89e9bc61e0bda337b982c4b9e8) to the `revdep/` folder 
(containing information on reverse dependencies) was performed, resulting in the deletion of `revdep/failures.md` and `revdep/problems.md`, each containing 50k+ rows.

As a bit of a surprise I've noticed some duplication in contributor names (Romain Francois vs. Romain François) which is completely fine given it is fairly common to
change machines and rewrite your .gitconfig file over the years. I might add some de-duplication logic in some future revision.

## Deploying

### Streamlit Share

For showcasing simple enough dashboards, if control over machine type and setup flexibility is not a strong priority, streamlit already offers a 
[platform](https://share.streamlit.io/) to publicly share dashboards. This solution is invite-only but it only took ~24h to get an invite code in my case.

To set it up it is enough to have your dashboard files in a **public** repository (containing a `reuqirements.txt` file) and deploy a new app from the GUI.
You can check the final result at [this](https://share.streamlit.io/andodet/git-overview/app/dashboard.py) link.

### Google App Engine

When expecting large traffic volumes on a dashboard, Google App Engine can come to the rescue. This solution (as most of cloud providers) is particularly appealing
due to managed auto-scaling features. The first requirement for the deployment is to have a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/andodet/git-overview/blob/master/Dockerfile)
in place, it might be something along the following lines:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim-buster

# The dashboard can pull remote git repos
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get -y install git

COPY . .

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

WORKDIR app/

EXPOSE 8501
ENTRYPOINT ["streamlit","run"]
CMD ["dashboard.py", "--server.port=8080", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]
```

Secondly, a `app.yaml` file, containing deployment settings (auto-scaling settings will be set in this file) is needed:
```yaml
service: git-streamlit
runtime: custom
env: flex
```

Finally, we can deploy everything with a simple one-liner:
```sh
$ gcloud app deploy app.yaml
```
After this step, we should find the url for the freshly deployed app in console output.

## Closing remarks

I've found `streamlit` extremely intuitive and was surprised by the extremely small number of roadblocks I've encountered. As of July 2021 I think the tool feels a bit
like notebooks on steroids (not to be taken as a negative comment). While thinking about the whole journey, few points crossed my mind:
* Albeit I was building a very simple dashboard, I couldn't find any established best-practice on how to organize a very large project.
* Scalability: [`altair`](https://altair-viz.github.io/getting_started/overview.html) plotting library stores the entire dataframe on the client, this forces to pre-aggregate
the data before plotting.
* [`pydriller`](https://pydriller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), used to interact with git repositories, is a very powerful library but it can take a long to traverse through large commit 
histories. In case you want to analyse very long commit histories I'd suggest to use the [`repo`](https://github.com/andodet/git-overview/blob/master/app/repo.py) module 
(can be used as a cli utility) to process a commit histories and feed the dashboard the resulting .json file. This could be scheduled as a cron job that will download all 
commits for the previous day to (to avoid downloading the entire commit history each time), I can see this approach working when setting up a raspi for a big screen in an office.
* Being as very simple weekend project, I've consciously decided to overlook **testing**. Two points can be raised about it:
    * Data aggregation could be factored out from plotting methods to test them independently.
    * Frontend should be tested using a browser emulation like `selenium` as described in [this](https://blog.streamlit.io/testing-streamlit-apps-using-seleniumbase/) article. The approach
    is identical to testing Shiny apps: open the app, take a screenshot and check it is identical to a reference one previously stored.
