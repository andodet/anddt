      <description>On giving and old Macbook Air some rest In the past few weeks I wanted to get a sense of how many remote-friendly jobs are posted on stackoverflow on a given day. To do this, I&#39;ve written a small Python utility that parses their XML feed and uploads the results on a spreadsheet on Google Drive. So far so good.
I initially hosted this script as a crontab job on my old Macbook Air that sits collecting dust on a bookshelf.</description>

      <description>I&#39;ve always found well-written essays particularly fascinating, to the point that I&#39;ve decided to experiment on finding a method to convey messages effectively that suits me. In order to feel committed, I purchased a domain on Google Domains (took 5 minutes in total and €15) and hosted this basic website. I have always used R at work and I am planning to transition from sales/acc. management roles to more analytical ones, This space will be used to collect gotchas and observations I find interesting through this path.</description>
